## Introduction
This repository aims to provide a set of Python scripts for conducting Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. The scripts are designed to work in conjunction with a main running script, which is responsible for creating the mesh and executing the simulation.

The main running script serves as the entry point for the FEM analysis, orchestrating the various components such as mesh generation, solver setup, and post-processing. 

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced FEM practitioner, you'll find these scripts useful for running FEM simulations with Python. The clear separation of responsibilities between the main running script and the supporting scripts allows for modularity and flexibility in customizing your FEM workflow.

Feel free to explore the repository and adapt the scripts to suit your specific FEM analysis requirements.

## Installation
To use the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:
